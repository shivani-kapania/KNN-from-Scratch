# KNN-from-Scratch

The model for kNN is the entire training dataset. When a prediction is required for a unseen data instance, the kNN algorithm will search through the training dataset for the k-most similar instances. The prediction attribute of the most similar instances is summarized and returned as the prediction for the unseen instance.

## Steps ##

1. Handle Data: Open the dataset from CSV and split into test/train datasets.
2. Similarity: Calculate the distance between two data instances.
3. Neighbors: Locate k most similar data instances.
4. Accuracy: Summarize the accuracy of predictions.
